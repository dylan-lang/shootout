========

This directory holds the various source files necessary to run "The Computer
Language Benchmarks Game" previously known as the "Great Computer Language
Shootout."  You can find the required entries and rules at
http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/

Some benchmarks have been removed over time but are still maintained since
they may be of value for additional microbenchmarking.

In general, we want each example to be one file (if possible).
